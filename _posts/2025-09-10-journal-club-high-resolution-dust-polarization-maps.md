We will kick off this year with a journal club and discussion on September 10. Minjie Lei (Stanford) will present new results on generating high-resolution dust polarization maps from multi-tracer data, utilizing a transformer-based multi-image superresolution technique.

The session will include a concise presentation by Minjie, followed by a discussion of the work and its potential for integration into future PySM models.
