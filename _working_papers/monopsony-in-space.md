  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  <p>Around 40% of employees in Canada work within 5 km of their place of residence, indicating that workers' set of suitable employers are limited by high commuting costs. I leverage a subway expansion in Vancouver to show that workers who gained subway access experienced an increase in earnings by 1.5%, and conditional on switching jobs traveled farther to their new employer. I build and identify a two-sided labor market matching model featuring wage-posting, \textit{explicit} commuting costs, and residential choice. I allow labor markets to be porous and use commuting flows to identify indifference curves between earnings and commuting. Model simulations show that estimated treatment effects from the expansion are driven by a reallocation of workers to more productive firms. Using a model-based concentration index I show that labor market concentration dropped by 10-35% in treated areas. Finally, I use the model to show that the distribution of firms across space explains 15% of the spatial variation in wage markdowns within cities. These results demonstrate the ability of the model to analyze the relationship between commuting costs, labor market power, and worker-firm matching at granular geographic levels.</p>
